# User Stories

These user stories are based on the use case diagram for the ALX Airbnb clone project. They reflect the core functionalities and interactions for both types of users: **hosts** and **guests**.

## For Guests

1. **As a guest, I want to create an account so that I can book properties.**

2. **As a guest, I want to search for and filter available properties so that I can find a place that suits my needs.**

3. **As a guest, I want to book a property so that I can reserve it for my travel dates.**

4. **As a guest, I want to leave a review after my stay so that I can share my experience with other users.**

## For Hosts

5. **As a host, I want to register an account so that I can list my properties for rent.**

6. **As a host, I want to create, edit, and delete listings so that I can manage the properties I offer.**

7. **As a host, I want to view booking requests so that I can accept or decline them.**

## For All Users

8. **As a user, I want to log in and log out of my account securely so that I can manage my activity on the platform.**

9. **As a user, I want to view my booking or hosting history so that I can track past and future transactions.**
